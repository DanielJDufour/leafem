**leafem** provides a few extra `add*` functions for use with leaflet (and mapview).

- `addMouseCoordinates` - add a box with mouse position, projection information and zoom level information
- `addLogo` - add images to maps
- `addHomeButton` - add zoom-to button to a map
- `addFeatures` - add features to a map, regardless of features type unresposnive
- `granishMap` - a "*one to rule them all*" function (similar to `*apply` family)
- `addImageQuery` - to display raster values on mouse hover/click

Here are some examples:

## addMouseCoordinates

let's add mouse position information along with detailed information about the layer's projection and zoom level information. By default, only `lon`, `lat` and `zoom` are shown. To also show info on the `epsg code` and the `proj4string` press and hold Ctrl and move the mouse. `addMouseCoordinates` also allows us to copy the info about the current mouse position to the clipboard by holding the Ctrl and left-clicking on the map. If we want this information from the clipboard to be used in our current R session, we can use `clip2sfc()` to convert it to a simple feature column of type `POINT`.

```{r addmc default}
library(mapview)
library(leaflet)
library(leafem)

leaflet() %>% addTiles() %>% leafem::addMouseCoordinates()
```

------

## addLogo

can be used to add logos (or any type of image really) to a map

```{r logo r}
img <- "https://www.r-project.org/logo/Rlogo.svg"
leaflet() %>% addTiles() %>% addLogo(img, url = "https://www.r-project.org/logo/")
```

<br>

arguments `offset.x`, `offset.y` together with `position` give control about image placement. See `?addLogo` for details

```{r logo banana}
m <- mapview(breweries)

addLogo(m, "https://jeroenooms.github.io/images/banana.gif",
        position = "bottomleft",
        offset.x = 5,
        offset.y = 40,
        width = 100,
        height = 100)
```

------

## addHomeButton

can be used to add 'zoom-to-layer' buttons to a map. By default located in the bottom-right corner of the map (can be changed using argument `position`)

```{r home}
library(raster)

leaflet() %>% 
  addTiles() %>% 
  addCircleMarkers(data = breweries91) %>% 
  addHomeButton(ext = extent(breweries91), layer.name = "Breweries")
```

------

## addFeatures

is a type agnostic `add*` function which will call the approprate `leaflet::add*` function based on the provided feature type (points, lines, polygons). It is currently defined for handling objects from packages `sf` and `sp`. For `sf` objects, in addition to the standard feature types `POINT`, `MULTIPOINT`, `LINESTRING`, `MULTILINESTRING`, `POLYGON` and `MULTIPOLYGON` it can also handle features of type `sfc_GEOMETRY` which are a collection of mixed types.

```{r addpols}
library(leafem)

leaflet() %>% addTiles() %>% addFeatures(breweries)
```

<br>

The standard styling arguments for `leaflet::add*` functions can be used just like in the original `add*` function

```{r addpols style}
library(leafem)

leaflet() %>% 
  addTiles() %>% 
  addFeatures(franconia, weight = 1, fillColor = "grey", color = "black",
              opacity = 1, fillOpacity = 0.6)
```

<br>

------

## addImageQuery

can be used to display raster image values when hovering over a layer:

```{r imageq}
library(plainview)

leaflet() %>%
  addTiles() %>%
  addRasterImage(plainview::poppendorf[[4]], layerId = "popp") %>%
  addImageQuery(plainview::poppendorf[[4]], layerId = "popp")
```
