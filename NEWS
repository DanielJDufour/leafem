leafem 0.0.5

new features:

  * addHomeButton now infers bounding box without having to pass extent object. Also it now handles vectors of c(xmin, ymin, xmax, ymax) - e.g. via sf::st_bbox().
  * addLocalFile has gained argument `tms` to specify whether tiles are TMS tiles.
  * new function `updateLayersControl` to update (or add) layers control when adding new base or overlay layers to an existing map.
  * added support for 'mapdeck' maps in addFeatures.
  
miscellaneous:

  * garnishMap now uses match.arg and try to be more robust.
